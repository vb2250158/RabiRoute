# RabiLink Android app

> Status: experimental app. This is the primary Android project for the RabiLink phone companion and embedded glasses frontend. Xiaomi Health, Rokid, and ADB diagnostics remain available, while several hardware paths still require real-device acceptance.

Users install one phone APK. The project also builds the glasses frontend that the phone delivers through the CXR workflow. Hardware probes remain under advanced diagnostics instead of defining this project as an example:

```text
com.rabi.link
```

## Current product route (2026-07-20)

The project now builds one phone companion and one glasses frontend:

```text
glasses com.rabi.link.glass
  <-> audio/media/status only
phone com.rabi.link
  <-> Relay, selected PC, cursor, and glasses settings
RabiLink Relay
  <-> Rabi PC glasses endpoint owns ASR, TTS, Agent, and action gates
```

- `GlassAudioClientActivity` is the default glasses entry. `glass-app/` is the glasses application module; the primary path handles audio, media, status, and HUD presentation without running ASR/TTS locally.
- The normal phone home is a conversation list. Every configured persona remains visible even when its Route or chat capability is disabled; such rows retain configuration guidance instead of disappearing. Tapping a persona with an enabled RabiLink message adapter opens chat; Back returns to choose another persona. Settings, health, and glasses remain separate surfaces.
- The phone sends continuous 16 kHz mono phone/glasses PCM through the restricted `audio-streams/rabilink/start|chunk|stop` endpoints to the selected Rabi PC. Android owns no VAD, utterance segmentation, ASR, or voiceprint logic. RabiSpeech segments and recognizes on the PC, then automatically writes the host-wide speech store and the RabiLink/mobile endpoint frozen by `routeProfileId`. Stream start submits stable `source_device_id` separately from transient `stream_id`, so normal replies target the real device rather than an audio-suffixed stream identity. `/api/rabilink/speech/messages` remains compatibility/debug only; spoken output is synthesized by Rabi PC TTS and streamed back as PCM when requested.
- The glasses HUD shows explicit Connect / Listen / Upload / Speak / Paused / Error states. The phone sends `PLAYBACK_BEGIN → PCM → PLAYBACK_END` over the same ordered Classic-BT channel. The playback worker does not accept PCM until the main thread has confirmed capture is paused, preventing the beginning of TTS from being recorded back into the microphone. Glasses validate message identity and PCM length and return `played` only after the `AudioTrack` playback head reaches its marker; Activity destruction reports an unfinished playback as `playback_failed`. Legacy PCM without BEGIN/END may still play for compatibility but is never reported as confirmed playback.
- Photos are wired as message attachments. Relay/worker accept video-file attachments, but the physical glasses video callback is not yet wired and live video is not complete.
- Persona avatars are served through the Manager's controlled avatar endpoint and proxied by Relay. The phone caches only the proxied binary and opaque version. Conversation metadata and local messages render immediately; avatars load independently and expose loading, cache-validation, stale-cache, and unavailable states. A `persona_avatar_changed` SSE event refreshes only the matching persona.
- `RabiConversationService` owns the message cursor, notifications, and phone/glasses I/O. `RabiPhoneAudioCapture` owns the wake lock, stall detection, bounded restart, and health metrics. Continuous PCM is first fsynced into phone-private dynamic `.partial` shards and atomically sealed with a monotonic id, timestamps, byte count, SHA-256, and upload state. Capture does not wait for Relay/PC/network I/O. A shard becomes eligible for cleanup only after the PC returns a matching `sequence + chunkId + accepted_bytes + sha256` acknowledgement.
- Settings exposes one persisted `Paused / Phone mode / Glasses mode` source of truth. Switching to glasses pauses the phone microphone first. Glasses PCM starts only after a real glasses Bluetooth connection event; before connection or after disconnect, capture stays paused with a visible reason and never silently falls back to dual capture. The runtime card refreshes from service broadcasts and shows connection, selected Route/persona, capture, glasses, reliable queues, and the latest error without one-second business-state polling.
- Settings now opens a read-only “Audio and transcripts” view scoped to the installation's stable `rabi-phone-*` device id. It separates received PCM chunks/bytes from runtime ASR counters (shown only when attributable to the selected input), and lists successful non-empty ASR records from the last 24 hours. Opening the view never renews audio expiry; offline failures remain explicit instead of presenting cached data as live.
- Users can choose `Agent decides / Quiet / Balanced / Proactive`. The value is durably queued as an explicit preference observation and attached to phone text, control, media, and audio-stream metadata. Neither the App nor Relay converts it into a fixed intervention rule. No interruption, preparation, prompt, recommendation, confirmation, or action remains a PC context/Route safety/target-Agent decision.
- Phone-private reliable queues use fsync plus atomic replacement. Startup removes incomplete temporary files; malformed JSON or missing media binaries are moved into quarantine with a visible error so later queue items can continue.
- AIUI feature work is paused; old speech probes remain historical diagnostics only.

The embedded glasses APK is installed by the phone CXR workflow, so the user still installs only one phone APK.

For optional diagnostics of the always-on audio path, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-RabiMobileDurableAudioSoak.ps1 -Serial <adb-serial> -Mode Offline -DurationHours 24
.\scripts\Test-RabiMobileDurableAudioSoak.ps1 -Serial <adb-serial> -Mode Online -DurationHours 72
```

Offline acceptance uses phone-local `lastWrittenAt`, `nextSequence`, and `rejectedBytes`; online acceptance additionally requires `lastUploadedAt` and the RabiSpeech sequence to advance. The monitor reads metadata and counts only, never tokens or PCM. `Start-RabiMobileDurableSoak.ps1` runs a recoverable 24-hour offline phase followed by a 72-hour online phase and restores the captured network state in `finally`. Short fault injection does not count as either long soak.

Each app installation creates its own stable `rabi-phone-*` device id and reuses a stable audio stream id across reconnects. Several phones register automatically with RabiSpeech and may remain online together; a later phone never steals the input selected in the speech-service page. Only the selected phone feeds VAD/ASR, while a temporarily offline selection is retained and resumes after reconnect.

**Automatically start voice service after Rabi opens** is the sole launch-time capture switch. When off, the App restores text, media, and downlink transport without starting the phone or glasses microphone.

The implementation continuously captures ordered PCM without Android-side VAD; it does not create one raw 24-hour file. The audio callback only enters a bounded receive queue, while a dedicated single writer owns `.partial`, `fsync`, atomic sealing, and explicit backpressure gaps. Each shard keeps a stable sequence, `chunkId`, source, Route, byte count, checksum, and upload state. A process restart recovers a partial only from its durable ownership sidecar. Corrupt metadata, missing PCM, and checksum failures quarantine the related pair, write a stable gap, and unblock later shards; quarantine counts toward the storage watermark and is deleted only after an explicit user confirmation in Audio & Transcripts. Android connectivity events or a restored RabiLink SSE connection wake upload immediately. While Android knows the device is offline, transport waits on the system network event gate. Each queued shard is uploaded only through a stream matching that shard's source and Route. RabiSpeech persists the processed `source + chunkId + bytes + SHA-256` tuple in a local idempotency ledger, so replay after a lost ACK and RabiSpeech process restart is acknowledged without entering ASR twice. Reliable text/media/receipt facts remain until acknowledged. PC-finalized ASR segments and Agent TTS follow the RabiSpeech contract: per-file 24-hour caching plus daily JSONL metadata with safe relative paths and expiration times.

The phone home screen also exposes Wearable Health settings with a Health Connect or “Xiaomi Health (PC ADB Companion)” source selector, stable device identity, sync/lookback periods, thresholds, cooldown, and sleep-state alerts. An obtained Xiaomi authentication key is AES-GCM encrypted through Android Keystore and remains phone-local. Health Connect prefers manual, startup-recovery, or platform events. Xiaomi's ADB Provider exposes no reliable change notification, so an explicitly enabled PC Companion keeps a low-frequency poll at the phone-configured minute-scale interval. The sole `RabiRouteHost.exe` owns that Companion through the Manager plugin kernel and a generation process lease; `/meta` plus both identity headers fence the dynamic READY endpoint, with no logon task and no saved or guessed Manager port. Structured samples enter the RabiRoute health timeline instead of the conversation ledger. See [`../../docs/rabilink-wearable-health_en.md`](../../docs/rabilink-wearable-health_en.md).

### First-run setup and failure guidance

- The home screen automatically scans the local network for Rabi PCs. After RabiLink login, a single online worker is selected automatically, so a first-time user does not need to understand workers, routes, or cursors.
- Connection details supplied by an installer, pairing payload, or future QR flow are filled automatically. When the RabiLink URL or mobile login code cannot be obtained safely, the page explains the security boundary and where to copy it from Rabi PC.
- The page header only summarizes overall state. When a field fails, its reason, expected value, source, and fix stay directly below that field instead of forcing users to map a separate “why” section back to the form or rely on transient toasts.
- Common fields, selectors, and actions share one Rabi mobile component scale. Device IDs, controlled polling/lookback windows, model fields, and thresholds are hidden under Advanced settings by default.
- Wearable setup prefers Health Connect and can generate a stable device ID and source name. Save and enable validates RabiLink, the system Health Connect provider, or the Xiaomi key first; if a prerequisite is missing, it saves a disabled draft instead of claiming that sync succeeded.
- The Rokid screen defaults to a six-step connection guide: automatic environment check, phone permissions, Rokid authorization, link, glasses-side installation, and launch. The SDK matrix and logs are collapsed; steps that require system confirmation explain why they cannot be completed silently.
- The test center, RabiRoute SDK, Xiaomi BLE/cloud, Provider-boundary, and OAuth screens now share the Rabi component system. They are explicitly labeled as advanced diagnostics, and raw logs stay collapsed so first-time setup never depends on developer pages.

### Everyday chat and navigation

- Home lists every configured persona returned by Rabi PC without filtering it out by Route-enabled or current `rabilink` chat capability. Wearable-health Routes are not mistaken for personas; a persona without enabled chat explains the problem and links to the fix.
- Each row renders the persona name, latest message, time, and unread count immediately from an endpoint-scoped on-device cache while its avatar loads independently. Page and system Back return from detail to the same list position.
- Draft and read position are scoped per conversation. Opening one persona never clears another; legacy messages without a Route migrate to one deterministic conversation.
- Normal chat no longer contains a persona dropdown or Configuration Assistant mode. Known fields are edited where they belong in Settings/remote WebGUI; unknown fields use a separate assistant launched from Settings.
- Notifications aggregate per conversation, carry `routeProfileId`, and deep-link cold or warm launches to the correct detail. Back still returns to the list.
- Attachment, composer, and Send controls use one 52dp action height. Text and media report queued, sending, handed to Rabi PC, or a concrete failure instead of treating queue insertion as delivery.

An embedded glasses-side test APK, `com.rabi.link.glass`, is bundled for CXR CustomApp experiments. It is a test payload installed by the phone-side workflow, not a second phone application for users.

## Current conclusions

The Xiaomi path is an evidence probe. Public BLE/GATT inspection, Health Connect empty-result verification, and Provider permission-boundary tests are useful. Real-device ADB checks now read the latest local heart rate plus a current sleep report and stages, but a stable background API for full-day or historical heart-rate lists has not been established.

The Rokid phone module uses CXR-L for authorization, connection, CustomView, audio, photos, controls, and device status. The explicit foreground status service can report real glasses battery and charging state to Relay without creating a CustomView session.

Historical AIUI traffic reached Relay through the paired phone's network proxy; that product route is now paused. In the native-app route the phone explicitly serves as the glasses backend, while Agent ownership, the conversation ledger, and PC configuration truth remain on Rabi PC.

The shared Android SDK can publish record-first portable observations and read broadcast or targeted downstream messages by independent cursor. The probe does not silently start a microphone or pretend to be an unlimited background service.

Native Rokid speech remains unclosed. CXR CustomApp and CustomCmd work, but Glass SDK services were unavailable in the tested environment. The 32-bit glasses-side RokidAiSdk package passed asset, ABI, and permission readiness but still requires legitimate voice-product credentials and real service acceptance.

## Application structure

The conversation list and chat detail are the normal user entry. Settings owns Rabi PC connection, continuous conversation, wearable health, glasses, and remote configuration. Hardware/API probes live in a separate Advanced Diagnostics center.

- `bridge/` defines `DeviceModule`, `Capability`, `ProbeResult`, `BridgeEvent`, storage, and module registration.
- `modules/xiaomi/` contains BLE, GATT, Health Connect, local Provider, cloud OAuth/SDK, evidence export, and related test screens.
- `modules/rokid/` contains CXR-L authorization, link state, CustomView, audio, images, controls, device status, and native-voice experiments.
- `modules/rabiroute/` exercises the shared Android SDK and RabiLink contracts.
- `glass-app/` builds the embedded `com.rabi.link.glass` test APK.

The phone app requires Android 12 or later (`minSdk 31`).

## Build

Use JDK 17 and the repository Gradle wrapper:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug :glass-app:assembleDebug
```

The wrapper pins Gradle 8.6, downloads it from a public China-accessible mirror, and verifies the official distribution SHA-256. Outputs are `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` and `glass-app/build/outputs/apk/debug/glass-app-debug.apk`.

The always-on phone build uses the slim package without local ASR/TTS model assets. This export entry runs JVM unit tests and a complete APK build, then verifies arm64-v8a, the 25 MiB size ceiling, absent model assets, zip alignment, and Android v2 + v3 signatures:

```powershell
.\scripts\Export-RabiLinkMobileSlimApk.ps1 -JavaHome "<JDK 17>"
```

After the same `app-debug.apk` has already completed a full build, repeat only the independent package checks with:

```powershell
.\scripts\Export-RabiLinkMobileSlimApk.ps1 -SkipBuild -JavaHome "<JDK 17>"
```

The verified output is `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/RabiLink-Android-<versionName>-verified.apk`. The script prints structured JSON containing package/version metadata, ABI, model-asset and optional-SDK-isolation checks, signatures, size, SHA-256, and the absolute output path.

Some RokidAiSdk experiments expect local AARs or assets under ignored `out/reference/` paths. Missing proprietary assets may prevent those variants from building or becoming ready. Do not commit credentials or licensed binaries without redistribution permission.

## What the probe can test

- BLE advertisements, standard device information, battery, and public GATT characteristics.
- Xiaomi Health Connect, local Provider boundaries, cloud SDK pagination, and sanitized evidence export.
- Rokid CXR-L authorization, connection, CustomView, audio capture, photos, brightness, volume, and device information.
- Glasses battery/status synchronization through Relay.
- Portable-device observations and cursor-based downstream messages through `RabiRouteSdk`.
- Multiple native and external ASR/TTS hypotheses with explicit readiness and failure evidence.

## Product boundary

This APK is a capability probe and phone companion. It is not RabiRoute itself, not a Codex Runtime, and not an MCP endpoint. Real Agent messages remain owned by the configured RabiRoute path and Codex/ChatGPT Desktop IPC.
