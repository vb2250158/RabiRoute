# RabiRoute Documentation

This directory contains current guides, experimental integrations, designs, research, and historical handoffs. The existence of a file does not mean its feature is complete; check its status before relying on it.

## Status definitions

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Current fact | Checked against code, schemas, WebGUI, and tests; safe as the current version's public position. |
| Current guide | Covers implemented behavior but still needs continuous review as code evolves. |
| Experimental integration | A code entry exists, while the external system or hardware path still requires environment-specific acceptance. |
| Needs refresh | Contains useful material but is known to include stale or conflicting statements. Prefer Current Capabilities. |
| Planned | A proposal, requirement, or roadmap rather than an implemented loop. |
| Historical | A superseded path, research record, or handoff rather than the current primary path. |

## Start here

- [RibiWebGUI User Guide](user-guide/README_en.md) — **Current guide**. Start here on your first use to complete a real delivery, read status, change rules, and recover from common failures.
- [Getting Started](getting-started_en.md) — **Current guide**. Install RabiRoute, start Manager, and confirm that the console opens.
- [Interface and status](user-guide/interface-and-status_en.md) — **Current guide**. Understand the current Route, Manager connection, unsaved changes, runtime state, and Settings-page screenshots, selected-text menu, and login startup.
- [Interface theme](user-guide/interface-theme_en.md) — **Current guide**. Shared light, dark, follow-system, and bounded custom themes for WebGUI and the Windows tray.
- [Runtime, logs, and troubleshooting](user-guide/operations-and-troubleshooting_en.md) — **Current guide**. When a message does not arrive, start with the diagnosis summary and locate the break.
- [Safety, replies, and data](user-guide/safety-and-data_en.md) — **Current guide**. Check permissions and privacy before enabling external replies or sharing diagnostics.
- [Current Capabilities and Maturity](current-capabilities_en.md) — **Current fact**. Check what is verified and what still needs a real account, network, or device acceptance run.

## Local installation, configuration, and recovery

- [Configuration](configuration_en.md) — **Current guide** for the 28 built-in Manager plugins, `provides/requires/optional` dependencies, the single initialization path, declarative routes, shared-resource lifecycle, WebGUI/Desktop extension entries, and AstrBot ChatUI-only configuration.
- [Resident performance recording and inspection](performance-monitoring_en.md) — **Current guide** for optional continuous Manager, Gateway, and WebGUI metrics, trends, slow operations, and independent JSONL files.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting_en.md) — NapCat, encoding, Codex Desktop task ownership, models, and approval boundaries.
- [Windows launcher and packaging](windows-launcher-and-packaging_en.md) — Windows installation, startup, and packaging.
- [Unattended NapCat](napcat-unattended_en.md) — QQ login state, quick login, Manager recovery, and supervision boundaries.

## Routing, personas, and handlers

- [Routing and personas](routing-and-personas_en.md) — **Current guide** for route/role boundaries and persona decision templates.
- [Agent context injection](agent-context-injection_en.md) — **Current guide** for the persona-scoped bidirectional ledger, per-endpoint/conversation recent-message budgets, archival boundaries, persona-directory and cross-persona credentials, paths, and reply context inside `AgentPacket`.
- [Rabi Agent interfaces](rabi-agent-interfaces_en.md) — **Current contract** for handler replies, persona discovery, idempotent one-way cross-persona delivery, receipts, thread bridge, plans, memory, Remote Agent, and role skills.
- [Plans and memory](plan-and-memory-model_en.md) — **Current guide** for Role Knowledge sources, recall, explicit consolidation, and side effects.
- [Unified dynamic record lifecycle](dynamic-record-lifecycle_en.md) — **Current guide** for archival, memory consolidation, physical sharding, retention, and the 24/72-hour dynamic windows.
- [Pipeline presets](pipeline-presets_en.md) — Agent-session defaults, explicit external targets, and Outbox statuses; FenneNote output is archival compatibility only.
- [Agent Adapter Integration Lessons](agent-adapter-integration-lessons_en.md) — **Current guide** for duplicate sessions, missing tools, inverted ownership, desktop startup dependencies, and verification.
- [Standard Agent Adapter Requirements](agent-adapter-standard-requirements_en.md) — **Current guide** for discovery, authentication, tasks, idempotent creation, delivery, results, tools, lifecycle, UI, security, and acceptance.
- [Codex Desktop Agent Integration and Acceptance Contract](codex-desktop-agent-acceptance_en.md) — **Current fact** for stable IDs, side-effect-free scanning, automatic initialization, the Desktop owner boundary, and metadata bootstrap gates.

- [LAN Rabi Agent bootstrap and updates](lan-rabi-agent-bootstrap_en.md) — **Experimental integration**. Covers headless-node bootstrap, the LAN connection Token, Rabi Web update requests, and the current Codex Desktop task-owner limitation.
- [Historical mobile-app Webhook plan](mobile-app-webhook-integration_en.md) — **Historical**. The current RabiLink path no longer requires a phone bridge as the main relay.

Archived material is under [`archive/`](../archive/README_en.md). Buildable clients live under [`apps/`](../apps/README_en.md), reusable SDKs under [`packages/`](../packages/README_en.md), and copyable samples under [`examples/`](../examples/README_en.md).

## Documentation maintenance

1. Check code, schemas, APIs, WebGUI, and tests before updating the Chinese fact source.
2. Maintain the English version manually only after behavior is accurate; do not batch-translate stale documents.
3. Design documents must be labeled Planned or Historical instead of appearing in the current-capability list.
4. Runtime-semantic Markdown (`AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, personas, prompts, memories, and plans) must not be translated mechanically.
