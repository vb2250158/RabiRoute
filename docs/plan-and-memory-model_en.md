# Plans and Memory Model

> Status: current guide. Checked against `src/roleKnowledge.ts`, the Manager API, and tests. Implemented behavior and future work are separated explicitly.

RabiRoute remains a message gateway and Policy Router. Plans, memories, and role skills are handler-maintained context for routing and execution; they do not turn RabiRoute into an Agent OS, project manager, or autonomous planner.

## Storage model

Role knowledge is stored under:

```text
data/roles/<RoleId>/
  personaConfig.json
  persona.md
  growth.md
  skills.md
  skills/*.md
  plans/active/<planId>/
    plan.json
    history.jsonl
    feedback.jsonl
    attachments/
    feedback-attachments/<feedbackId>/
  plans/archive/<planId>/
    plan.json
    history.jsonl
    feedback.jsonl
    attachments/
    feedback-attachments/<feedbackId>/
  memory/recent/*.md
  memory/consolidated/*.md
  memory/consolidation-runs/*.json
  identity-relations/events.jsonl
```

The filesystem is the source of truth. The Manager API reads and writes these files. Qt and WebGUI keep plan content read-only; approval feedback stays on Manager-declared approval steps, while RibiWebGUI also accepts whole-plan guidance when Manager returns `presentation.acceptsGuidance=true` outside approval.

`plan.json` is the sole business source of truth for the current plan state, and Manager creates, updates, and archives it only through the plan-storage Repository. Legacy-layout migration, incomplete-transaction recovery, and canonical-directory reconciliation determine plan-storage read/mutation eligibility, with every attempt running in a terminable one-shot child. Manager endpoint and identity, the complete required-plugin set, and handler READY do not wait for NAS recovery, so Host and Tray remain on the current application generation. While eligibility is `running` or `degraded`, existing read-only endpoints remain available, plan mutations fail closed, and `/health` reports the degradation explicitly. Once eligibility is ready, runtime modules use only the recovered canonical layout and neither scan nor read the legacy layout. Migration never reads attachment bodies. When legacy and canonical content are identical, a manifest-and-receipt transaction retires the duplicate; divergent content is preserved as evidence and fails plan mutation closed. Moving a plan from `active/` to `archive/` is likewise one lease-owned Repository lifecycle transaction, not a bare `rename` or background migration.

### Identity-relation memory

Identity-relation memory has the `identity_relation` knowledge type. It is persona-private material alongside plans and recent memory, but it never enters the 24/72-hour recent-memory consolidation flow. It stores endpoint accounts, participant entities, and relation cards as append-only events:

```text
data/roles/<RoleId>/identity-relations/events.jsonl
```

An account key is exactly `platform + endpointIdentityNamespace + senderStableId`. Route configuration IDs, display names, avatars, and the current topic are not identity keys. One account may have candidate or confirmed participant mappings, while one participant may have multiple accounts. A relation card records collaboration, reporting, or decision scope between people, organizations, and projects, with `candidate`, `confirmed`, `corrected`, or `retired` state, group/project scope, and minimal evidence references.

This data resolves participants only. It must not turn platform privileges, a temporary speaking role, or one discussion into business authority. Candidate relations cannot support naming, authorization, project attribution, or execution. Delivery places project relation cards that apply to the current conversation into the Situation record, but that means only that the Agent may participate in the discussion; it never grants management of that project's plans, tasks, or long-term memory. Multi-PC synchronization unions events; when concurrent heads for one record disagree, the current view explicitly marks a conflict and stops automatic confirmation instead of choosing one by file order. One persona correction containing every material field supersedes all current heads and lets later synchronization converge. A handler confirms or corrects identity relations explicitly through the API; identity context on a delivery does not require a plan/memory callback.

## Plans

`plan.status` stores only an enabled status `key` from the owning persona's `personaConfig.json.planWorkflow.statuses`. The same persona configuration owns labels, descriptions, colors, order, views, step rules, approval rules, completion behavior, and archive eligibility; code, WebGUI, and the tray keep no second status enum. The default template contains these ten statuses, with keys independent from display labels:

```text
`分析中`  analyzing
`待补充信息` awaiting information
`待审批`  awaiting approval
`执行中`  executing
`等待打包` awaiting package
`等待 QA` awaiting QA
`待讨论` awaiting discussion
`暂停`    paused
`完成`    completed
`关闭`    closed
```

Business code resolves lifecycle meanings through `planWorkflow.roles`. `roles.informationNeeded` is used after analysis establishes that the goal, scope, acceptance criteria, or implementation evidence is still insufficient; when the missing information arrives, the plan returns to `roles.analysis`. `archiveStatus` is independent and accepts only `未归档` or `已归档`. Only a status configured with `terminal=true` and `archiveEligible=true` is archived after `planWorkflow.archiveAfterHours`, without changing its key. Archived plans do not participate in keyword recall. Manager returns the key with its configured label, description, palette, order, and views; clients never interpret the key or derive another status from step text.

`planWorkflow.schemaVersion=3` removes the step status field. The first read of a v1 or v2 persona configuration preserves custom statuses and their relative order; v1 also inserts the default information-needed definition after analysis, then writes v3. Once migrated, a status removed through the Agent status API is not restored.

Read the status catalog with `GET /api/roles/:roleId/plan-statuses`. An Agent can add a status with `POST`, change presentation or behavior with `PATCH /:statusKey`, and remove one with `DELETE /:statusKey`; writes require both `If-Match` and `Idempotency-Key`. Keys are immutable. Removal requires `replacementKey`: Manager first migrates unarchived plans still using the old key, then retains the old definition as `retired` so archived plans and append-only history remain readable. Physical deletion is allowed only after historical references are gone.

A plan describes one focused objective. Common fields:

```

`steps` is the ordered execution path and stores no separate status. `currentStepId` points to the current step, while `completedAt` records a finished step; later steps carry no state field. The actual plan phase is stored only in `plan.status`, and its definition comes from `personaConfig.json.planWorkflow.statuses`. `detail`, `waitingFor`, `approvalRequest`, and step IDs provide execution evidence. Manager maintains step `startedAt` and `completedAt` timestamps.

An explicit discussion wait writes the key referenced by `planWorkflow.roles.discussion`. An ordinary pause uses `roles.paused`; resumption chooses the key referenced by the real next role, normally analysis or execution.

`attachments` is the optional plan-level attachment list. For a new attachment, an Agent may provide a local `path`, or `name`, optional `mimeType`, and `contentBase64` in POST/PATCH. Manager validates and copies the content into that plan directory: `plans/active/<planId>/attachments/`. Plan JSON stores only `id/kind/name/path/size/mimeType/sha256` metadata and never stores Base64. A plan may contain up to 8 attachments, limited to 10 MiB each and 25 MiB in total. Omitting `attachments` from PATCH preserves the current list; sending `attachments: []` clears the list from the plan record.

After runtime data is copied as a unit or the installation root changes, an older `plan.json` may still contain an absolute path under the previous root. Manager does not read that old location. It resolves the same filename only inside the current plan-managed attachment directories and requires both file size and SHA-256 to match the plan metadata; otherwise the attachment is reported as unavailable.

WebGUI never reads the stored local path directly. It requests files through `GET /api/roles/:roleId/plans/:planId/attachments/:attachmentId`. PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF images; MP4/M4V, WebM, Ogg Video, and MOV/QuickTime videos; and Markdown files all render in compact, fixed-width 16:9 preview cards that shrink only when their container is narrower. A Markdown card streams at most the first 12 KiB of source, turns it into a plain-text excerpt capped at 180 characters, and clamps the visible lines without executing HTML, links, or images; clicking it opens the complete document dialog. Images open in an in-page large-image preview, while videos open in an in-page player with controls. Video responses support byte ranges; actual playback codecs still depend on the current browser. Markdown files up to 2 MiB render GFM headings, lists, tables, blockquotes, and code in-page; raw HTML, dangerous or relative links, and remote image loading are disabled, while the dialog retains a source-download action. Other files show name, type, and size and open or download through the attachment response. The read boundary rechecks that the real path remains inside that plan's managed directory, failing closed on traversal or symlink escape.

A current step that requires approval should include a complete `approvalRequest`. `approver`, `request`, `recommendation`, `alternatives`, and `reason` state the owner, decision, preferred and fallback choices, and rationale. `files` lists exact paths, `create/modify/delete/move`, and the concrete edit; `commands` contains complete commands, purpose, and expected effects; `changes` identifies configuration, database, cloud, or external-system targets. `validation`, `rollback`, and `outOfScope` define acceptance, recovery, and explicit exclusions. `requestedAt`, `sourceMessageId / feedbackId`, and `responseStatus` record request provenance and receipt state. At least one of `files / commands / changes` must be concrete. Missing fields produce `presentation.approval.state=incomplete` and `enabled=false`. The plan uses `roles.analysis` while independent analysis remains possible, or `roles.informationNeeded` after analysis confirms that a load-bearing fact is missing. Once the contract is complete with `responseStatus=pending`, the Agent stores the approval-role key; Manager returns `ready/enabled=true` without rewriting the status.

Manager normalizes legacy plans at the read boundary: `未开始 → 暂停`; `进行中 → 待审批 / 执行中 / 分析中` according to a complete pending approval contract or the retired execution marker; `已完成 → 完成`; and `已归档 → status=关闭, archiveStatus=已归档`. Retired `workPhase`, `discussionState`, and handwritten `isBlocked` participate only in compatibility reads and are removed by the next canonical POST/PATCH. The system never invents an approver, provenance, recommendation, alternatives, or request time.

`secretaryBinding` is the plan's exact current control-plane owner and is separate from the business `taskBinding`. It stores the bound Agent type, complete session ID, display name, workspace, optional DSH apiproxy origin, and assignment time. When control delivery first needs an owner, Manager selects one stable session from the enabled Route pool and persists it. A governance `begin/finish` updates the binding to the Secretary actually managing that plan. A still-configured binding is reused; reassignment happens only after the binding becomes unavailable or leaves the configured pool.

`taskBinding` is the optional exact plan-to-execution-session binding. `agentType` determines the session owner: `codex` uses a Codex Desktop task and `dsh` uses a DSH session. `sessionId` is the required complete ID; `sessionTitle` is display metadata; and `workspace` supplies the execution directory for each plan delivery without needing to equal the Codex task's saved default cwd. DSH still validates workspace ownership and may store `baseUrl` for its actual apiproxy. `completionHook.enabled=true` applies only to Codex completion callbacks: Manager handles the official final answer after that task finishes a turn; when a Plan Secretary is enabled and bound it delivers directly to `secretaryBinding` without writing the Primary Persona role-panel timeline; otherwise it falls back to the same persona's Route. `gatewayId` disambiguates multiple Routes. Delivery is deduplicated by `sessionId + turnId` and records a stage-completion fact only; it does not advance steps, change plan status, or write memory automatically. A plan whose status key is referenced by `planWorkflow.roles.paused` receives no completion reminder, so the binding is not re-driven while paused.

Manager exposes the read-only batch endpoint `GET /api/roles/:roleId/plan-agents/status?planId=...`, resolving each `taskBinding` and optional `secretaryBinding` by `agentType + sessionId` and reporting the binding workspace as the next-turn execution directory. Codex reads the Desktop task by complete ID without comparing its saved default cwd; DSH reads the session through its bound `baseUrl` or the local default apiproxy and still validates workspace ownership. Agent work state is returned separately from the session's `active / idle / not_loaded / unavailable / archived / missing / workspace_mismatch` state; `workspace_mismatch` applies only to adapters with fixed workspace ownership. A timeout or read failure is `unknown`; plan lifecycle state is never used as a substitute. `POST /api/roles/:roleId/plan-agents/:planId/open` locates an exact verified, unarchived Codex task by ID; DSH also requires a workspace match. It sends no prompt, creates no session, and does not change the binding.

`taskBinding` identifies the plan's independent business-execution task; it never points to a persistent plan secretary. Secretaries are control-plane workers: they maintain plans and memory, resolve and deduplicate business tasks, inspect real status, consume results, and continue the bound task. Investigation, implementation, testing, Unity/SVN/build/release work, and external-system changes belong to the business task. A secretary may create temporary child agents only for plan inventory, deduplication, status checks, and result summaries; neither the secretary nor those children modify business files.

After a business-task completion reminder, the responsible Secretary directly consumes the result, PATCHes the plan and memory, and continues the exact business `taskBinding.sessionId + workspace` when the plan remains actionable. Ordinary progress, state changes, waiting conditions, and next actions remain with the Secretary. It escalates only decisions, approval, authorization, missing user input, cross-plan conflicts, complete closure, or safety-reviewed outbound communication to the Primary Persona. Pausing a plan or rotating a Secretary never clears the business binding. Rebinding is allowed only after the business task is genuinely unavailable and a controlled migration has completed; completed plans may retain the binding as historical evidence. Completion callbacks, heartbeats, and resume inspections should use all available Secretary slots across management shards and end only when both `actionable plans without management = 0` and `actionable but idle business tasks = 0`. Already active business tasks are not sent duplicate turns. Authorized inquiry and evidence gathering continue without bypassing action gates.

PangHu work remains actionable when the formal Main Unity Editor is open, importing, running another test, temporarily unavailable through MCP, or using a shared test queue. A Secretary must not turn these conditions into a global freeze or a wait for an exclusive workstation, and must not stop the Editor, cancel another run, or overwrite unrelated changes. The original business task continues implementation, narrow SVN updates and merges, static asset/prefab/configuration and direct-serialization contracts, non-Unity runners, and CLI validation. GameView, PlayMode, or interaction checks that cannot run concurrently become explicit human or later runtime acceptance items. Unrelated full-suite failures do not block matched validation or feature development, but their failures and skipped checks remain recorded.

Plan-management writes are isolated by `planId`: one control-plane writer per plan, with different plans allowed to proceed concurrently. Shared ledgers, issue mappings, and delivery receipts are read at the latest version inside short file locks, merged only at the target record, and atomically replaced; a stale whole-file snapshot must never overwrite another plan. Lock metadata is fully written to a candidate and atomically published with a same-volume hard link. The hot path never deletes a stale or corrupt lock automatically: it fails closed, and repair is allowed only during an explicitly quiescent maintenance window with writers paused. `claim` and `clarify` use a separate lease keyed by source message and stable operation key, persisting a reservation before delivery. An uncertain send or a sent-but-unverified result remains `uncertain` / `sent_unverified` and is never resent automatically.

A fresh `work-cycle begin` reads the plan and recent memory before it creates the bound task's history snapshot or persists a cycle. Idempotent Manager GETs use bounded retries with a per-attempt timeout; POST, PATCH, and other potentially side-effecting requests are never replayed automatically. If recent-memory reads still fail after retry exhaustion, begin releases the plan lease and leaves neither a started cycle nor a history snapshot for that attempt. The error remains visible to the secretary; a later direct GET success does not retroactively complete the failed begin.

Global strict audit is observational and compares ledger snapshots from before and after validation. Only a cycle whose identity stayed stable can become `invalid`; a cycle that appeared, disappeared, or changed during the audit is `incomplete`. Active cycles or plan leases make `quiescent=false` but do not block unrelated plans. Plan closure uses plan-scoped strict audit, while global quiescence is reserved for explicit maintenance or final drain. Thread-status reconciliation likewise skips only active plans and continues the rest.

The target Codex Route must already have an exact task ID and must differ from the execution session. Multiple plans bound to one execution session, workspace mismatch, execution-context persona mismatch, a missing or wrong-persona gateway, or multiple same-persona gateways without `gatewayId` all fail closed. The capability remains experimental until verified between two real Desktop tasks.

An unarchived plan remains visible until its configured status has both `terminal=true` and `archiveEligible=true` and its latest `updatedAt` exceeds `personaConfig.json.planWorkflow.archiveAfterHours`. A role-knowledge snapshot then changes only `archiveStatus` to `已归档`, preserves the status key, sets `archivedAt`, and moves the whole directory from `plans/active/<planId>/` to `plans/archive/<planId>/`. The default template uses 72 hours, while each persona may configure a different delay.

## Focus and write limits

Every plan and memory must have a single-line `focus` describing one subject. Independent subjects belong in separate items.

Default plan limits:

```text
titleChars=80
focusChars=80
currentStepChars=1200
stepTitleChars=120
stepDetailChars=600
stepWaitingForChars=300
stepBlockedByChars=300
approvalRequestChars=600
approvalReasonChars=600
approvalPathChars=1000
approvalDetailChars=800
approvalCommandChars=2000
approvalListItemChars=800
maxSteps=100
nextActionChars=600
waitingForChars=300
blockedByChars=600
sourceSummaryChars=240
keywordChars=32
maxKeywords=24
totalChars=12000
```

Default memory limits:

```text
titleChars=80
focusChars=80
contentChars=4000
sourceSummaryChars=240
keywordChars=32
maxKeywords=24
totalChars=4600
```

Override these limits under:

```json
{
  "knowledgeLimits": {
    "plan": {
      "totalChars": 3200
    },
    "memory": {
      "contentChars": 5000
    }
  }
}
```

Invalid writes fail with HTTP 400; RabiRoute does not silently truncate them. Validate all existing files with:

```http
GET /api/roles/:roleId/knowledge-validation
```

## Recent memory

Recent memory stores a focused fact, preference, conclusion, or unresolved question that is still editable or waiting to be consolidated. Once Manager writes `consolidatedAt`, the source file remains under `memory/recent/` for audit traceability but moves to the Archived category and no longer counts or appears as recent memory.

```json
{
  "id": "memory-example",
  "title": "Documentation follows implementation",
  "focus": "documentation fact-source rule",
  "content": "Check code, schemas, APIs, WebGUI, and tests before maintaining the English version.",
  "keywords": ["documentation", "fact source", "tests"],
  "source": {
    "kind": "agent",
    "summary": "Confirmed during the audit"
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-07-16T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-16T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`keywords` is required. RabiRoute's hot-path recall matches IDs, titles, and keywords rather than tokenizing every body.

Memory now distinguishes direct viewing from a true recall hit:

- Reading a recent or consolidated memory by ID refreshes `viewedAt`.
- Updating recent memory refreshes both `updatedAt` and `viewedAt`.
- A recall match placed in required reads refreshes both `viewedAt` and `recalledAt`.

The editable and default-context windows still use the later of `updatedAt` and `viewedAt`, so an Agent can explicitly read and then correct an old recent memory. The 24/72-hour consolidation clock instead uses the later of `updatedAt` and `recalledAt`; a direct read does not postpone consolidation, while a true recall hit or update does.

New recent and consolidated memories are stored as Markdown files. Lifecycle, source, keyword, and trace fields stay in frontmatter, while the body is ordinary readable Markdown. Legacy `.json` memories remain readable. If both formats contain the same ID, Manager prefers `.md` and counts the item once. WebGUI renders headings, lists, tables, code, links, and mixed text/images; images load only from HTTP(S), while local absolute paths and dangerous protocols are blocked.

## Current memory windows

```text
recentEditableHours = 24
recentConsolidationHours = 72
```

These are fixed defaults in the current implementation, not public persona configuration fields.

- Recent memories active within 24 hours are listed directly in the packet.
- Older unconsolidated memories are normally omitted but can still be recalled by ID, title, or keyword.
- An explicit consolidation request is due when an unconsolidated recent memory has not been updated or recalled for more than 72 hours.
- When the least-active memory reaches 72 hours, Manager freezes that run's `triggerAt` and its candidate ceiling at `triggerAt - 24 hours`. A late execution does not add memories that crossed 24 hours after the original trigger. An update or true recall before execution can still remove an item by changing its activity time.

Manager dynamically projects `triggersNextConsolidation` and `willEnterNextConsolidation` booleans onto recent-memory list items. The projection is cached with the memory catalog and invalidated after a create, update, or recall hit. WebGUI displays those booleans instead of recalculating the candidate set.

The consolidation run stores `triggerMemoryId`, `triggerAt`, `candidateCutoffAt`, and `deliveredAt` after Desktop accepts the request. A Manager restart does not redeliver the same accepted run. The UI projection and the actual request use the same Manager-owned cohort function.

The Manager API can override the two thresholds for one consolidation request.

## Consolidated memory

Consolidated memory is a stable, recallable record produced from one or more recent memories and shown in its own Consolidated Memory tab. It stores `inputMemoryIds` and `consolidationRunId` for traceability. Existing consolidated memories have no ordinary update endpoint. The source records marked with `consolidatedAt` are shown separately under Archived together with archived plans.

If a consolidated fact is wrong, create a corrective recent memory. A later run can produce a new stable item without mutating history in place.

## Automatic and explicit consolidation flow

Current entry points:

1. Manager's one-shot deadline scheduler when the least-active memory reaches 72 hours.
2. The built-in `manual_trigger` with `triggerId=memory-consolidation`.
3. `POST /api/roles/:roleId/memory/consolidation-requests`.

```json
{
  "triggerOlderThanHours": 72,
  "includeOlderThanHours": 24,
  "force": false
}
```

When due, RabiRoute creates a run under `memory/consolidation-runs/` and supplies the eligible recent memories to the handler. `force=true` skips the due check but does not include items still inside the editable window.

Manager schedules the earliest known 72-hour deadline without a resident polling loop. At the deadline it rereads current memory activity, so an update or true recall can postpone the run before delivery.

A Codex Route may enable a dedicated Memory Consolidation Agent. Automatic or manual `manual_trigger + triggerId=memory-consolidation` delivery then goes only to the persistent Desktop task `<Primary Persona task name> 记忆整理`, using `gpt-5.6-terra` by default. The Primary Persona does not receive the same request. Missing Desktop ownership or delivery failure fails explicitly without a fallback Runtime or Primary-Persona retry. The switch chooses the handler; it does not enable or disable the 72-hour scheduler.

The handler returns:

```json
{
  "type": "memory_consolidation_result",
  "memories": [
    {
      "title": "Stable documentation rule",
      "focus": "documentation fact-source rule",
      "content": "Public documentation is calibrated before its English version is maintained.",
      "keywords": ["documentation", "fact source"]
    }
  ]
}
```

to:

```http
POST /api/roles/:roleId/memory/consolidation-runs/:runId/result
```

RabiRoute writes the consolidated output, completes the run, and marks each input recent memory with `consolidatedAt` and `consolidationRunId`.

## Recall and packet injection

The packet includes lightweight indexes rather than full bodies:

- active plans;
- recent memories inside the active window;
- active role skills;
- matched knowledge and skills;
- a required-read list, normally up to five items, with GET endpoints.

Candidates include all non-archived plans, unconsolidated recent memories, consolidated memories, and non-archived role skills. A non-archived plan enters the default active-plan index when its configured status `views` includes current; other unarchived statuses remain available to the plan view according to their configured `views`. Active plans and active recent memories receive only a small ranking bonus. A candidate must still match the current message to enter required reads.

The handler must read required items before replying, changing role knowledge, delegating work, or taking an external action.

Both `/roles/...` and `/api/roles/...` prefixes are accepted. Public documentation prefers `/api/roles/...`.

Long plan lists use `GET /api/roles/:roleId/plans?limit=8&cursor=<offset>&detail=summary&view=<current|plans|archived>&query=<text>` to read lightweight batches of eight within the selected category and search. Each summary includes the current-step title, progress counts, and attachment count, so WebGUI mounts it immediately without waiting for the body. When a card approaches the viewport, `GET /api/roles/:roleId/plans/:planId?detail=preview` reads only its body preview, current-step detail, blocker information, and attachment metadata; image, video, and Markdown attachments remain visible on the collapsed card. Expanding the card calls the single-plan endpoint without `detail` to fetch complete steps and approval contracts. Feedback, live Agent state, and revision history remain separate on-demand reads. Later summary pages send `facets=0`, yield one rendering frame between batches, and do not keep the first-screen global loading indicator active. Viewport previews allow at most four concurrent requests, and directory navigation moves the target preview to the front of that queue. Off-screen cards retain browser `content-visibility`. Manager keeps its two-level incremental plan cache and reuses presented ordering while the plan catalog is unchanged. Preview and full-detail reads prefer the warm list cache. Directory watchers coalesce write bursts and asynchronously reread only changed plan JSON; canonical POST/PATCH writes update the exact cache entry, while filesystems without watcher support fall back to short-TTL validation. These are derived read caches only, and plan files remain the sole source of truth.

Memory lists can call `GET /api/roles/:roleId/memory?kind=<recent|consolidated|archived>&limit=24&cursor=<offset>&query=<text>`. WebGUI requests only the currently visible recent, consolidated, or archived-memory category, returns at most 24 items for the first screen, and requests more on scroll instead of transferring every memory when the page opens. Manager reuses parsed memory catalogs until their directory changes. When the browser tab is hidden, the knowledge page stops further loading, closes its Manager event connection, and ignores stale request results; becoming visible triggers one catch-up read for the current category.

Plan pagination also accepts `sort=<status|updated|importance|urgency>`, repeated `status=<presentation-status>`, repeated `tag=<keywords-tag>`, and `facets=0`. `updated` compares the `updatedAt` timestamp. The other three modes compare Manager-projected integer levels. Status uses `statusLevel`; importance and urgency use `0–4`, where `0` is highest, `1` high, `2` medium, `3` low, and `4` not set. Legacy `priority` strings are converted once at the read boundary. A legacy plan without `urgency` may derive a compatibility level from `dueAt`. Sorting never compares display labels. The response also carries the Chinese and English labels plus palettes for each level, and WebGUI only renders them. Manager applies filters and sorting before pagination.

## Plan guidance and approval feedback

Plan feedback is an independent JSONL audit record stored as `feedback.jsonl` inside the same plan directory. `kind=guidance` is plan-level guidance associated only with `planId` and must not carry `stepId`; `kind=approval_suggestion` is formal feedback associated with an approval step. Neither is a second copy of the plan JSON or the generic Outbox Action Queue.

The read endpoint returns complete `records` after collapsing delivery-state updates for the same `feedbackId`. RibiWebGUI can load them on demand from every plan detail and preserves plan-guidance and approval-feedback history after approval, completion, and archival. `latest` remains only a lightweight summary and delivery-state signal.

## Plan revision history

The plan JSON is the current-state record. Every create, update, and archive also appends a full plan snapshot to that plan directory's `history.jsonl`. The snapshots retain the steps, approval contract, status, and timestamps from that point, so later Agents can review the actual plan before and after an approval result.

```http
GET /api/roles/:roleId/plans/:planId/history
```

RibiWebGUI provides a collapsed **Work history** section in every plan detail. It separately shows plan guidance, step approval feedback, and plan revisions. Completion, a move to `archive/`, or leaving the pending-approval state never removes these records from the interface. Archiving changes only the default plan view and the plan JSON directory; it does not delete feedback files, feedback attachments, or revision history. Removing local runtime data is a separate manual file operation, not a plan lifecycle action.

RibiWebGUI submits plan guidance with `kind=guidance`, `author=user`, `source=webgui`, and `notifyAgent=true`, without `stepId`; Manager accepts it only for running plans that are not currently in an approval step. WebGUI and tray approval submissions continue to use `kind=approval_suggestion`, `author=user`, `source=webgui|tray`, and `notifyAgent=true`. Plan guidance and approval use the same feedback composer, so both support `@` references to plan attachments, keyboard submission, file selection, clipboard paste, attachment previews, and removal. Future composer capabilities must be added through this shared component so both inputs receive them together. Newly uploaded content is stored under the same plan directory's private `feedback-attachments/<feedbackId>/` directory; JSONL records never embed the binary content. Both feedback types are durably recorded before returning `deliveryStatus=pending`. A complete business binding goes through `/api/agent/threads` and Desktop IPC to the original task; with Plan Secretary enabled, the responsible `secretaryBinding` simultaneously receives the control notice and the Primary Persona is not notified for every automatic delivery. An incomplete business binding sends the full feedback to the Secretary first, falling back to the Primary Persona only when no usable Secretary is enabled. Retry, terminal status, and `plan_feedback_changed` semantics remain shared.

After receiving `guidance`, the Agent first reads the current plan and feedback, treats the guidance as whole-plan direction, and explicitly `PATCH`es the plan plus any later steps affected by changed scope, priority, method, or path. It then writes `kind=guidance_response`, `author=agent`, and `notifyAgent=false` under the same `planId` without `stepId`. Approval feedback still updates the affected plan/step and approval receipt before writing `approval_response` under the same `planId / stepId`. Neither record advances a plan automatically.

While background delivery is pending, WebGUI keeps the next draft editable but prevents another submission until the prior feedback reaches a terminal state. Plan guidance appears only when `presentation.acceptsGuidance=true` outside approval; approval plans continue to expose only the approval contract and approval input inside the owning step.

## Manager presentation order and plan views

Manager uses the current step's `approvalRequest` as the approval-entry contract. A complete actionable contract with `responseStatus=pending` requires the status key referenced by `planWorkflow.roles.approval` and produces `presentation.approval.state=ready` and `enabled=true`. An incomplete contract produces `incomplete` and requires the status key referenced by `roles.analysis`. Legacy `isBlocked` is only a compatibility projection, and `blockedBy` is explanatory text; neither changes plan status.

Manager keeps `plan.status` as the status key and supplies the configured display name through `presentation.label / labelEn`. Description, palette, integer order, and view membership come from the same status definition. Clients display the configured label rather than the key and never derive another status.

`nextAction`, `currentStep`, step titles, and `waitingFor` explain work and waiting reasons only. They never override `plan.status`.

For content-changing work, lifecycle transitions use the keys referenced by `planWorkflow.roles.execution / package / qa / completed`; QA failure returns to `roles.analysis` or `roles.execution`. The default template displays this as `Executing → Awaiting package → Awaiting QA → Completed`. The Agent writes the package-role key only after applicable sync, commit, and conflict-free readback, and writes the QA-role key only after target-package inclusion is proven. Manager validates that evidence but does not infer a status from step text. A QA delivery receipt is evidence inside the configured QA stage, not another main status.

`presentation.status` must equal the key in `plan.status`, while display uses the configured label. Status order comes from each definition's `order`, and non-archive view membership comes from `views`. Archive view membership comes only from `archiveStatus`, not from any status assigned to the closed role.

The secretary's `reconcile-thread-statuses` command consumes this same Manager `presentation` and cross-checks it against structured delivery and environment evidence in the issue ledger and latest completed cycle. Terminal and complete approval waits become `terminal / blocked`; paused plans become `frozen + paused` with `implementationDispatchAllowed=false`; `waiting_package` and exclusive-environment waits backed by current `waiting_environment* + environment-owner` evidence also become `frozen`, unless an authoritative release for the same PID/project supersedes that owner evidence. A structured dependency step or tracking state becomes `frozen_until_dependencies` only when it explicitly waits for other plans' original owners to finish and the plan, issue, and cycle evidence also says that no independent CLI, control-plane, or business action remains. Contacting or coordinating owners, completing a missing contract, obtaining a reply, or retaining a CLI, retry, or fallback path keeps the plan `actionable`. A QA or ordinary inquiry with a real `status=sent / sentMessageId` receipt becomes stable `waiting_result` when issue/cycle evidence explicitly says that only the result remains, no independent local action exists, no separate review or confirmation request is still unsent or unresolved, and resending is forbidden. An older QA receipt cannot cover a later owner review or placement confirmation. That receipt may come from structured issue evidence or the latest cycle summaries and is not invalidated by later plan updates or the ordinary deduplication window. A merely recent ordinary send still uses `waiting_result_dedup`. Only idle plans with remaining local work, missing real delivery/receipt, an explicitly due follow-up, a separate pending inquiry, a retry, or an alternative path remain `actionable`; a delivered inquiry does not get repeated merely because local work remains. The result exposes separate `frozenIdle`, `waitingResultIdle`, and `actionableIdle` collections. `implementationDispatchAllowed` is true only while implementation work may still run; terminal, paused, approval-blocked, package, cross-plan-dependency, test-environment, renewed-authorization, and QA-verdict waits return false because no implementation action remains.

For the refined states, `waiting_package` returns `frozen_until_package + wait_for_target_package`; a cross-plan dependency with no independent action returns `frozen_until_dependencies` with `requiredAction=null`; a real test-infrastructure wait returns `frozen_until_test_environment + wait_for_test_environment`; renewed authorization returns `waiting_for_authorization + request_authorization`. These waits set `implementationDispatchAllowed=false`. The green QA stage also forbids implementation dispatch: a missing QA receipt with a repairable send path returns `actionable + send_qa_request`, while a sent request that only awaits a verdict returns `waiting_result + wait_for_qa_result`. Strict audit rejects a QA step that claims only the verdict remains without a current receipt. Available CLI or fallback validation remains actionable, while ordinary missing external information continues to use `inquire_until_result`.

The Qt tray and RibiWebGUI consume the same Manager DTO, palette, and order. RibiWebGUI uses four tabs: `Current Plans / Recent Memory / Consolidated Memory / Archived`; Archived includes plans whose `archiveStatus=已归档`. Archived plans are excluded from keyword recall even when title or keywords match. Only an explicit plan-ID read or the Archived view can return them. Neither client reads `data/` directly or invents another status.

Both the Qt tray and RibiWebGUI's Plans & Memory page consume this Manager DTO and its existing order. Neither reads `data/` directly nor maintains a separate status or sorting implementation. RibiWebGUI shows a non-duplicate `focus` below the plan title and nests the approval contract inside the step card identified by `presentation.approval.stepId`. Search examines all content values returned for a plan or memory, including steps, current actions, waiting/blocking details, approval contracts, attachment metadata, memory bodies, and source summaries, instead of limiting matches to title, focus, and keywords. Its page-level directory floats outside the plan panel, stays sticky, and scrolls within the viewport; it contains only the plans visible under the current tab and search query, while plan cards remain in normal page flow.

## Qt tray view

The Qt panel displays current plans, recent memory, consolidated memory, and diagnostics. It does not create, complete, archive, delete, normalize, or migrate plan/memory content. Approval-enabled plan cards may append formal feedback through Manager without changing the plan itself. Incomplete approval contracts keep approval input disabled in both clients; RibiWebGUI's whole-plan guidance appears only when the plan is outside approval.

## Boundary

RabiRoute does not convert raw chat logs into memory automatically and does not decide what the handler should remember. The handler creates focused plans and recent memories. RabiRoute provides storage, indexing, validation, recall side effects, explicit consolidation runs, plan-content/memory views, and constrained plan-guidance and approval-feedback entries.
