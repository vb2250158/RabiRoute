# Cross-PC API calls

English | [简体中文](rabilink-peer-rpc.md)

For generic endpoint tunnelling and speech server selection, see [Cross-PC tunnels](rabilink-peer-tunnel_en.md). This page documents the legacy read-only protocol.

Status: experimental. Read operations support LAN, a public WebRTC connection attempt, and bounded Relay fallback. Automated coverage includes real local WebRTC channels, LAN preference, Relay fallback and application isolation. Cross-carrier public connectivity and sustained operation on two physical PCs require separate acceptance.

## Call another PC

Both online PCs must use the same RabiLink application token and advertise `peer-rpc-v1`. The Relay must also include `/api/rabilink/peer/proxy`. Obtain the local `managerBaseUrl` from Host `status --json`, then verify `/meta` health, application generation and Manager instance before using:

- `GET /api/rabilink/peer/list`: registrations with a categorized `summary`. Each item has `deviceKind` (for example `pc`, `phone`, `glasses` or `watch`), target ID, online state, capabilities and LAN addresses. Missing or invalid kinds become `unknown`; names and capabilities never imply hardware. `summary.total` counts registrations, not computers.
- `GET /api/rabilink/peer/list?deviceKind=pc&online=true`: only explicitly classified online PCs. Summary counts reflect the filtered result; without filters, unknown and offline registrations remain visible.
- `POST /api/rabilink/peer/call`: address a target by ID. These control endpoints are loopback-only; the remote data endpoint only accepts encrypted packets.

```json
{
  "targetDeviceId": "pc-b",
  "capability": "plans",
  "operation": "list",
  "input": { "roleId": "Example" }
}
```

The response includes `transport` (`lan`, `p2p` or `relay`) and `reply`. Business success requires `reply.ok`; the reply also identifies the request, device and runtime instance. `plans.list` returns only plan ID, title, status and update time. `persona.manifest` returns the selected persona's file manifest. `system.describe` requires no business grant and returns the instance and exposed operations.

## Target-owned access

PC event connections and worker requests explicitly report `deviceKind=pc`. Phone and glasses clients retain their existing `deviceKind` reporting. The updated Relay preserves a registered kind when an older client later omits it. Historical entries are not rewritten from their names; devices must explicitly report their kind again. Types are self-reported categories, not authorization credentials, and support custom extensions.

The target's runtime data root contains the sole grant source, `data/rabilink/peer-access.json`. Missing, malformed or oversized files (over 64 KiB) deny business access. Changes take effect on the next request.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "operations": ["plans.list", "persona.manifest"],
  "roleIds": ["Example"]
}
```

Grants cover the entire trusted application group. Members sharing a token share a cryptographic identity; device IDs provide addressing and wrong-target checks, not independent member authentication. Keep mutually untrusted PCs in separate applications. Joining does not automatically enable business reads, arbitrary Manager paths, task execution, outbound messages or file mutation.

## Transport and lifecycle

Discovery is provided by the shared RabiLink module and does not depend on persona data synchronization. Every call refreshes registered addresses, verifies the target and generation through encrypted `system.describe`, and binds its request to that generation. Requests and replies use AES-256-GCM with an application-derived key. LAN never carries the application token. Relay forwards encrypted packets only to `/api/rabilink/peer/receive`; callers cannot supply arbitrary URLs.

At most four registered private IPv4 addresses are tried, with a two-second discovery deadline each. If LAN is unavailable, encrypted SDP travels through Relay to establish a werift WebRTC DataChannel. STUN discovers addresses; TURN is not enabled. Each direct attempt has a twelve-second deadline, each connection serves one call, and at most eight connections coexist. Read requests can fall back to Relay, while business rejection remains a failure. Requests expire within two minutes; plaintext requests/results are limited to 1 MiB, with a separate wire limit.

The RabiLink Manager plugin owns routes and WebRTC connections. Disposal removes routes, closes connections and drains accepted HTTP operations. Requests bound to an old generation fail closed; callers must rediscover before issuing a new request.

This protocol version registers read operations only. Adding mutations requires durable target-side deduplication, receipt queries and uncertain-result recovery first. Do not register writes in the existing read retry flow.

## Existing contracts

Persona data synchronization has been removed from the source: LAN synchronization file transfer, merge and `/persona-sync/proxy` are no longer provided. Cross-PC access reads data on the target computer through RabiLink without creating synchronized replicas; read RPC does not acquire mutation permissions. Existing personas, plans, memories and conflict evidence are retained. Video retains its separate channel and prohibition on server-carried video bytes.

Checks: `src/rabiPeer.test.ts`, `scripts/rabilink-relay-peers.test.mjs`, and Relay runtime and shared peer LAN regressions. Source changes and automated success do not establish managed local deployment, remote Relay upgrades or physical dual-PC acceptance.
