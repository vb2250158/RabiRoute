# Unattended NapCat and Login Stability

> Status: current guide. RabiRoute can discover, manage, and launch NapCat instances, while QQ authentication and security verification remain the responsibility of NapCat and QQNT.

RabiRoute receives NapCat/OneBot events, records messages, evaluates routes, and delivers work to a handler. After the Manager starts listening, or when a user clicks **Start and manage login**, it can coordinate local startup, all three QQ login modes, and OneBot connection repair. QQNT and NapCat still define authentication and security-verification semantics; Rabi only proxies the current local operation. QQ passwords, cookies, and tokens must not be written to `data/route`, `data/roles`, examples, or the repository.

## Responsibility split

- NapCat starts QQNT, maintains the QQ login, and exposes local login, WebSocket Client, and HTTP Server APIs.
- RabiRoute listens for OneBot events, calls the HTTP API, reports health, and records routing events. With **Auto login when Rabi starts** enabled, it starts the bound instance, selects an existing quick-login account, and repairs OneBot endpoints in the background after the Manager is listening. **Start and manage login** enters the same flow from the current Route card.
- Windows Host starts RabiRoute; RabiRoute manages startup and termination of bound NapCat instances.

For password login, plaintext exists only in the current browser form and one Manager request. Manager immediately hashes it with MD5 for NapCat and never writes the plaintext or hash to Route configuration, logs, or the response. RabiRoute does not bypass CAPTCHA, new-device confirmation, or risk-control checks: the user still completes Tencent CAPTCHA and mobile-QQ confirmation, after which the card resumes health checks.

## NapCat login and management inside the Route card

One Route binds one NapCat; another QQ account belongs in another Route. **Start and manage login** follows this sequence without opening or embedding the NapCat WebUI:

1. If the target instance is online with the expected account, reuse the live session without restarting QQNT/NapCat.
2. If the target is not ready, scan configured and discovered local OneBot HTTP endpoints and use `get_status` plus `get_login_info` to determine whether another NapCat instance already owns that QQ account.
3. If another instance owns the live account, preserve that session and refuse to start or quick-login a duplicate. The UI identifies the live owner and offers an explicit **Use online instance** action.
4. If no other live owner exists and NapCat is stopped, launch it hidden with the instance's `launchCommand` and `workingDir`, then wait for the local management API.
5. The card obtains login state and QR content through Manager and exposes exactly three first-class modes: Quick login, Password login, and QR login.
6. Quick login lists only identities already saved by NapCat. Password login keeps Tencent CAPTCHA and new-device QR confirmation in the card. QR login renders NapCat's QR content as a local image.
7. Once QQ is logged in, Rabi writes and applies the instance's OneBot HTTP/WebSocket configuration and rechecks both OneBot and the RabiRoute WebSocket.

The browser calls only `/api/message/napcat-login-panel` and `/api/message/napcat-login-action`. The WebUI token and authenticated Credential remain inside Manager, and login responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`. The Route card does not own a NapCat management session or preserve the WebUI as a second control plane.

Manager reuses short-lived management sessions and combines concurrent authentication requests so status refreshes do not repeatedly log in and trigger NapCat authentication limits. Expired management credentials are renewed. Only explicit authentication rejection permits a retry; ordinary failures never replay accepted QQ login or configuration actions.

Health scans remain read-only. Login, startup, and configuration repair use the Manager-owned `napcat-ensure-ready` action. Startup auto login runs asynchronously after the Manager begins listening, and Manager readiness does not wait for NapCat checks or authentication.

Start, restart, and stop actions are serialized by the bound QQ account. A double click, two concurrent callers, or mapped-drive and UNC paths that resolve to the same NapCat installation can therefore enter only one lifecycle operation. Immediately before spawning, RabiRoute rechecks the live OneBot login and reuses a ready instance instead of creating a second QQNT/NapCat process tree. This guard protects process lifecycle only; it does not bypass QR login, CAPTCHA, device confirmation, or any other QQ security check.

The UI reports four separate layers: NapCat management reachability, QQ authentication, OneBot HTTP health, and the RabiRoute WebSocket connection. A reachable management API does not mean QQ is logged in, and a logged-in QQ does not mean messages are reaching RabiRoute.

On entry, the QQ card reads the account and connection state from one backend check and repeats it every three seconds. The saved account identifies the intended binding. If an endpoint returns another QQ account, the card displays both the actual and bound accounts with an account-mismatch warning. Offline OneBot responses never count as ready. Successful login hides the quick, password, and QR forms. When the management service is unavailable, the card shows startup guidance and retains any readable OneBot account information. Account logs exclude records explicitly belonging to another QQ account.

The login panel and health checks use the shared state definitions in `src/shared/napcatStateContract.ts`. Authentication and OneBot readiness are returned separately; unavailable management access does not make a signed-in account appear signed out. Login status, account mismatch, and QR prompts support Chinese and English, preserving account names and URLs.

After the tray starts, Windows Host allows up to 30 seconds for final health admission so a transient timeout during background startup does not cause repeated restarts. The current Manager identity and readiness must still pass before Host publishes the available endpoint. Expiry or process exit still fails startup.

**Use online instance** repoints the current QQ card's HTTP endpoint, WebUI endpoint, and working directory to a confirmed live instance that no other Route owns. Changing the working directory stops the old bound instance before adopting the selected instance; login credentials are not migrated. If it is not yet routed to the current gateway, the UI continues to request OneBot WebSocket repair.

## Route bindings and process cleanup

Route configuration is the authoritative binding source. Each Route can configure at most one QQ instance; saving multiple instances is rejected. The UI displays only configured instances, never adds discovery results as QQ cards, and does not create empty instances automatically. A newly bound instance can complete its first QR sign-in. Once an account is bound, quick and password sign-in requests for another account are rejected.

Start, automatic sign-in, restart, and connection repair require an enabled Route and NapCat endpoint. Startup sign-in waits until Route loading and binding cleanup finish, so an early empty configuration cannot cause accounts to be skipped. Removing an instance or Route, or disabling the Route or NapCat endpoint, first blocks new starts, drains running operations, verifies process identities, and stops the instance. A stop failure retains the record and blocks restart; removal is not reported as successful until cleanup succeeds. Turning off startup auto login only changes startup behavior; it does not remove the binding.

On Windows, Manager reconciles NapCat processes at startup and when bindings change. NapCat launchers without an active binding and their descendants are stopped. A separately running ordinary QQ client is excluded. Rabi cannot prevent programs from being started outside the application; such NapCat instances are handled during the next reconciliation described above. Complete Shell packages use their bundled QQ executable; older packages without bundled QQ retain their inner launcher.

Local process records in `data/.runtime/napcat-process-ownership.json` contain the Route, instance, directory, PID, creation time, and executable path. Identity is checked again before termination to avoid killing another program that reused an old PID. New instances use globally unique IDs and separate directories. Manager restarts resume ownership of still-bound instances. Correcting HTTP or WebUI URLs preserves signed-in QQ processes; switching a known bound account stops the previous instance. Unbinding does not delete NapCat files or login caches.

The API returns shared states including `unbound`, `stop-failed`, and `account-mismatch`, with Chinese and English messages.

## Unattended login

Normally, complete one QR-code login in the Rabi NapCat card and then rely on NapCat/QQNT quick login. If quick login is unreliable after a reboot, NapCat Shell can read account fallback data from the Windows user environment:

```text
ACCOUNT=<qq-account>
NAPCAT_QUICK_PASSWORD=<qq-password>
NAPCAT_QUICK_PASSWORD_MD5=<password-md5>
```

Prefer `NAPCAT_QUICK_PASSWORD_MD5`. Use the plaintext variable only when the installed NapCat version and deployment explicitly require it. The Rabi card handles CAPTCHA and new-device QR confirmation exposed by the current NapCat API. Face verification, SMS, or a future unsupported check remains an explicit human stop; Rabi does not bypass it.

## Persistent Windows environment variables

```powershell
setx ACCOUNT "<qq-account>"
setx NAPCAT_QUICK_PASSWORD_MD5 "<password-md5>"
```

If plaintext is unavoidable:

```powershell
setx ACCOUNT "<qq-account>"
setx NAPCAT_QUICK_PASSWORD "<qq-password>"
```

`setx` affects only processes started afterward. Restart NapCat Shell, its Windows service, or the user session as appropriate. During troubleshooting, report only whether a variable exists and its length; never print the credential.

## Auto login when Rabi starts

The NapCat bound to each Route has an **Auto login when Rabi starts** switch, enabled by default. After the Manager begins listening, it queues background work that reuses the correct live account or starts the bound NapCat Shell, selects an existing quick-login identity, and repairs OneBot HTTP/WebSocket configuration. Different Routes run concurrently, while work bound to the same QQ account remains serialized. Manager startup and WebGUI access do not wait for these steps.

Turning the switch off skips both startup auto login and runtime automatic recovery. **Start and manage login**, health checks, manual start, and restart remain available. CAPTCHA, QR login, and new-device confirmation are recorded as requiring user action and can be completed later in the same Route card.

## Process supervision

The RabiRoute Manager supervises route subprocesses it starts and reloads affected routes after changes under `data/route/*/adapterConfig.json` or `data/roles/*/personaConfig.json`. Enabled NapCat instances with automatic login enabled are observed every 30 seconds. Three consecutive failures trigger bound-account quick login or OneBot repair, with at least five minutes between attempts and a 90-second launch grace period. HTTP, the matching instance's WebSocket and the Gateway process are checked separately; HTTP readiness does not prove inbound recovery. Recovery never switches QQ accounts, creates duplicate instances or force-kills unknown processes. QR/security verification, account conflicts and mismatches still require user action. A transient login-probe failure is not evidence of required human verification. A waiting latch clears only on confirmed process absence, an explicit quick-login identity for the bound account, or owner-confirmed login with unavailable transport; ordinary unreachable observations do not interrupt an operator scanning a QR code. Outer watcher failures use cancellable backoff under the same owner without repeating startup login. Stop and plugin disposal cancel pending recovery.

Let Windows Host start Rabi, then use the Route's **Auto login when Rabi starts** setting to start its bound NapCat. Do not also supervise the same instance with a scheduled task or service: an external supervisor could start it again after unbinding.

Automatic recovery logs observations, attempts and results. If recovery fails or QR verification is needed, use **Start and manage login** in the corresponding Route and inspect NapCat logs, WebSocket state, HTTP `get_login_info`, and recent errors. HTTP reachability or acceptance of a repair request is not complete recovery. This repair has isolated-test coverage; actual disconnects, long-running cooldowns and inbound messages require separate post-deployment acceptance.

## RabiRoute health check

The NapCat adapter calls OneBot `get_login_info` every 60 seconds by default and writes the result to:

```text
data/route/<configName>/gateway-status.json
```

Change the interval with:

```powershell
setx NAPCAT_LOGIN_REFRESH_SECONDS "30"
```

Zero or a negative value disables this periodic check. The check only detects and reports login problems; it does not log QQ back in.

## Troubleshooting order

1. Refresh login state in the current Route's NapCat card and check QQ, OneBot HTTP, and RabiRoute WebSocket separately.
2. Check NapCat logs for quick-login, QR login, device verification, or clock-skew messages.
3. In RibiWebGUI, verify WebSocket connectivity and the HTTP login profile.
4. If the UI reports that the account is online in another instance, use that live instance instead of starting the same QQ twice. For a real migration, explicitly stop the old instance first.
5. If the saved quick-login identity has expired, switch the card to **QR login** and refresh the code rather than repeatedly retrying quick login.
6. If QQ disconnects frequently, synchronize Windows time before restarting NapCat/QQNT.
7. For unattended operation, configure Windows startup and then the NapCat-side `ACCOUNT` and password/MD5 variables.
